## 🎮 Game Modes

🕵️ Mr. White (Social Deduction)

![[flwo.mp4]]

A game of bluffing and intuition for 3+ players.

The Setup: Every player receives a secret word. Most get the same word (e.g., "Pizza"), but one person (Mr. White) gets a slightly different word (e.g., "Burger").

The Goal:

Civilians: Find the person with the different word.

Mr. White: Blend in and figure out the Civilians' word without getting caught.

The Twist: It's purely "Pass and Play"—no internet required for friends in the same room.

## ✨ Key Features

Retro Pixel UI: A clean, high-contrast black & white aesthetic inspired by old-school arcades.

Custom Animations: Hand-coded JavaScript scrolling text engine (no simple CSS marquees here!).

Single Page Application (SPA): Seamless transitions between menus and game phases using React Router and conditional rendering.

Custom Word Packs: Players can add their own inside jokes or specific words to the game pool.

Leaderboard: Tracks player wins across multiple rounds in a single session.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
